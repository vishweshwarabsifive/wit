# Wit
Workspace Integration Tool

## What is this?
Wit is a tool for managing workspaces. It is intended as a supplement to (not a replacement for) Git-based workflows.
The goal of wit is to enable development in a multiple user and repository environment.

A wit workspace is composed of one or more packages. A package is a git repository.
Each package may optionally contain a wit-manifest.json file which defines other packages upon which it depends.
Wit resolves this hierarchy of dependencies and generates a flattened directory structure in which each package
may exist only once.

## How does Wit deduplicate packages?
When multiple versions of the same package are requested, Wit chooses the latest requested version, making sure the selected version's commit is a descendant of every other requested versions' commits.

## Getting started

The best way to learn wit is to check out the [tutorial](share/doc/wit/tutorial.md).

### Installation

Wake is intended to be as lightweight as possible. It simply requires `git` and `Python` version 3.5 or greater.

You can simply clone the repo and add it to your `PATH`, for example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sifive/wit.git
PATH=$PATH:$PWD/wit
which wit
```

It also includes a `Makefile` for installing specific versions. The installation flow requires `make`, `rsync`, and `sed`.

```bash
make install PREFIX=/path/to/installation
```

The Makefile will create a directory with the version (it even works for commits between tags)
and copy the contents of contents of the local clone excluding the tests and metadata.


### Creating a workspace
Creating a workspace does not require a git repository to be specified. You may create an empty workspace with:

    wit init <workspace>

If you want to specify one or more packages when you generate the workspace you can use the `-a` option

    wit init <workspace> -a </path/to/git/repo/soc.git>[::revision]

The revision can be a tag, branch, or commit. Note that wit respects normal git behavior.

### Adding a package to a workspace

To add a package to a workspace that has already been created you use the `add-pkg` sub-command.

    wit add-pkg </path/to/git/repo/soc.git>[::revision]

### Resolve and fetch package dependencies

Once you have added one or more repositories to your workspace, you can use `update` to resolve and fetch
the transitive dependencies of each package.

    wit update

### Updating a package

You can update the revision of a package in the workspace using the `update-pkg` sub-command.

    wit update-pkg <package>[::revision]

If you update to `<package>::<branch>`, it will checkout the local version of that branch.
You can always checkout remote branches by specifying the remote as well

    wit update-pkg <package>::<remote>/<branch>

### Restore a previous workspace

If you have a matching pair `wit-lock.json` and `wit-workspace.json` from another workspace, you can create
a new clean workspace by providing those files to the `restore` sub-command.

    $ wit restore <new-workspace-name> -l </path/to/wit-lock.json> -w </path/to/wit-workspace.json>

Dependencies are only specified by the `wit-lock.json` file, no other dependency resolution is performed.
If you are keeping your wit-lock.json and wit-workspace.json under revision control you can do an in-place
restore

    $ git clone http://example.com/my_workspaces
    $ cd my_workspaces/project1
    $ ls
    wit-lock.json wit-workspace.json
    $ wit restore


## Autocompletion

Tab completion can be enabled via `source complete.bash`. If you want it to persist, see below.

### Bash

#### Linux
```bash
cp complete.bash /etc/bash_completion.d/wit
```

#### macOS
##### Homebrew
Install autocompletion for bash:
```bash
brew install bash-completion
```

After running the script, you should see instructions for how to finish installing it.

For example, on macOS 10.14.15, the output is:
```
==> Caveats
Add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile:
  [[ -r "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh" ]] && . "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"

Bash completion has been installed to:
  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d
```

So, in the above case, we'd add the following to our `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
[[ -r "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh" ]] && . "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"
```

then run:
```bash
cp complete.bash /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/wit
```

### Zsh

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completion
cp complete.bash ~/.zsh/completion/_wit
```

Make sure the following is in your `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
fpath=(~/.zsh/completion $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit -i
```

Then reload your shell:
```bash
exec $SHELL -l
```
